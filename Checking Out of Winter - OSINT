Hello, here is my thought process during the OSINT challenges for the IrisCTF2025

Challenge: 

CHALLENGE'S DISCLAIMER: Please do not include any accent markings or special characters into the flag. Apply proper capitalization to the flag. Here's an example of the flag irisctf{Iris_Hotel} if there is a special symbol like '&' please type out the word 'and'.

We took our annual road trip to Baja California Sur to visit the beach and play some golf. I like how this location is farther from the city compared to other resorts. I really enjoyed the sweet and savory sauce on the pizza with shredded chicken. After eating, I fell asleep, and half of my legs ended up getting tanned.

Question: Which hotel did Adam stay at?

Picture:

My first thought was to throw this into Google image search and only look for the architecture in the photo. It looks distinct enough that I should get close enough to the hotel.

This looked super close and I believed I had the hotel confirmed by an instagram post.

I believed the hotel was the Hilton Los Cabos

so I tried irisctf{Hilton_los_Cabos}

*that didnt work*

My partner (shout out to @medjay) tried Hilton_Los_Cabos_Resort_&_Golf

this wasnt working either

I started to go down rabbit holes looking for different hotels in california not Cabo


Nothing was working

I started to big brain it, look at the Exif data of the photo

*Nothing*

Medjay and I went down a hungry rabbit hole trying to find this pizza 



at this point, I made a ticket, I figured it was a me problem with the flag… I made a ticket with the organizer and they let me know I was close…

irisctf{Hilton_Puerto_Los_Cabos_Resort_and_Golf} didnt work

irisctf{Hilton_Los_Cabos_Resort_Beach_and_Golf} didnt work either

then Medjay figured it out 

irisctf{Hilton_Los_Cabos_Beach_and*Golf* Resort}

Brief steps:

- **Examine the Image**: Look for distinctive architectural features.
- **Google Image Search**: Find similar architecture, leading to Hilton Los Cabos.
- **Initial Flag Attempts**: Try variations like `irisctf{Hilton_los_Cabos}`, but they don’t work.
- **Explore Other Hotels**: Search for other hotels in the region, but still no success.
- **Check EXIF Data**: No useful clues from the image metadata.
- **Search for Pizza**: Investigate the pizza image as a side task, but it doesn’t help.
- **Ticket Raised**: Organizer confirms you’re close, refocusing the search.
- **Correct Flag**: Your partner identifies the correct flag: `irisctf{Hilton_Los_Cabos_Beach_and_Golf_Resort}`.
